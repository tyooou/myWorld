A retro-styled, pixelated interactive memory mapping experience built for the [SESA x WDCC Hackathon]([url](https://wdccxsesahackathon.com)) 2025 by Team Fullstack Big Backs, under the theme "Nostalgia".

Our application lets users create, explore, and share cherished memories on a beautifully rendered 3D globe. Every interaction is designed to feel like a journey through time: from the nostalgic pixel-art interface to the retro audio effects, the entire experience evokes the charm of early web and gaming eras.

Users can drop memory pins anywhere on the globe, attach photos, write reflections, and browse through others' stories across time and space. The app supports live collaboration, custom avatars, and seamless sharing through unique globe links. Whether it's childhood vacations, school moments, or digital friendships, every memory finds a place.

This project is more than just a map. It's a digital scrapbook shaped by community, creativity, and a longing for the past ‚Äî all brought together through modern fullstack engineering with a retro soul.
